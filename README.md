# Introduction
This project use llama2 70B instead of chatgpt to run Generative Agents.  
I tested running a single day with 3 agents in the town successfully.  
This will much cheaper than using Openai.  
Contribute This project is welcome. Let's build a world together!

This repository accompanies our research paper titled "[Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03442)." It contains our core simulation module for  generative agents—computational agents that simulate believable human behaviors—and their game environment. Below, we document the steps for setting up the simulation environment on your local machine and for replaying the simulation as a demo animation.
